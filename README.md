# ⏱️ Bootstrap Stopwatch

**Bootstrap Stopwatch** is a simple, clean, and fully functional web-based stopwatch application. It is built using standard HTML and vanilla JavaScript, with all visual components styled entirely by the **Bootstrap 5** framework.

This project is an excellent example of combining basic JavaScript time manipulation with modern, responsive CSS styling provided by a popular front-end framework.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Start** (Green) | Starts / Resumes | Begins timing from 00:00:000 or resumes from a paused time. |
| **Pause** (Blue) | Pauses | Temporarily stops the timer. The elapsed time is saved. |
| **Reset** (Red) | Stops & Clears | Clears the timer back to `00:00:000` and resets the controls. |

The time is displayed in the format: `MM:SS:mmm` (Minutes:Seconds:Milliseconds).
